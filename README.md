# Employee-Attrition-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Models
In this study, we have used Decision Trees, Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost, and K Nearest neighbors algorithm to predict Employee Attrition. Through a thorough evaluation process, we choose the best model based on the accuracy of these models in predicting employee attrition.
